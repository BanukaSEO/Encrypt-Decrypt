# Encrypt-Decrypt
This PyQt5-based GUI application lets users encrypt/decrypt messages using AES. Users input a secret key and plaintext message to get the encrypted output. Clicking "Decrypt" reverses the process. It uses ECB mode for AES and handles padding. Note this is for educational use, not secure communications.
